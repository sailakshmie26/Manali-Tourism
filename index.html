        <br>
           <div class="about-manali">
        <p>
            <span id="lan-clo">Manali,</span> nestled in the picturesque Beas River valley, is a gift of the Himalayas to the world. 
            Legend has it that Manali derives its name from the Hindu sage Manu, who is believed to be the 
            progenitor of the human race. The town is named “Manu-Alaya,” which translates to “the abode of Manu.”
            A rustic enclave that once lay dormant, Manali now stands as one of India’s most popular destinations. 
            Its transformation from a sleepy village to a bustling town is a testament to its rich cultural 
            heritage and age-old traditions. <br>
            Manali’s allure lies in its cool climate and snow-capped mountains. Tourists flock here to escape 
            the scorching heat of the plains. Imagine waking up to a glorious sunrise, surrounded by 
            breathtaking views—the glacial waters of the Beas River meandering through the valley, inviting 
            adventure enthusiasts for rowing, white water rafting, and river crossing.
            So, whether you’re a seeker of legends, an adventurer, or simply captivated by the Himalayas, 
            Manali awaits with open arms!
            <br> <br>
            <span id="lan-clo">Languages:</span> Hindi, Punjabi & English are understood and spoken by the people engaged in tourism trade.
            The local people usually speaks in the kulluvi dialect. 
            <br> <br>
            <span id="lan-clo">Clothing essentials:</span> With increasing altitude, temperature falls in the valley and weather can
            change very abruptly in this region. Thunderstorms and snowfalls do cause a sharp drop in temperature 
            turning an otherwise warm day into a cold one in a matter of minutes. <br>
            Woolens are essential when visiting Manali. In summers, light woolens with a scarf for the evenings
            will have you prepared should it get chilly. Remember, Manali’s weather can be unpredictable, so layering is key.
            Also remember to add a basic first aid kit and AMS medications if venturing to high-altitude areas. <br>
            Pack wisely and enjoy your Himalayan adventure!
